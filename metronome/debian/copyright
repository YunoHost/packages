Comment: Metronome itself is licensed under the ISC License whereas some portions weren't MIT
  licensed it will be noted accordingly by not having a header pointing to this file and
  having *.license file pointing to them instead.
  .
  As MIT allows sublicensing of the software, the whole codebase is ISC licensed where of
  course not stated otherwise by the above mentioned. Although parts of the software which
  are substantially unaltered or weren't created / extensively modified by the maintainer
  see below are effectively dual licensed under MIT (Expat) and ISC, as provisioned by the
  definition of "sublicensing".
  .
  In the Lua community this license is better known as "MIT".
  Unfortunately other variants of this license are also known as "MIT".
  To obtain a machine intepretable copyright file Debian prefers to name this
  version of the MIT license using the non ambiguous term "Expat".
